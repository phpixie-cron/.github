# PHPixie Cron

PHPixie Cron is a collection of tools revolving around cron and scheduler-like tasks in PHP. These are more modern versions of tools like [`dragonmantank/cron-expression`](https://github.com/dragonmantank/cron-expression), built from the ground up for modern versions of PHP while retaining the multiple years of knowledge built up with that project. This will also allow us to offer more packages that can utilize and build additional features on the standard "is this a valid cron?" or "should I run now?" that the older library originally set out to solve.
